# Stuff I want to work on yet

- Build Step Definition for Apply Time zone | Drop down menu of time zone
  - or check a box to enable location services (should this be it's own setting somewhere else)

- Language stuff
- Company Branding - Registered to: etc
- Defender Updates
- OEM Tools Offline Mode (offline repo for updates)
- create step to enable Features like HyperV with option to reboot.
- create script for easy import and overwrite of updated steps and content for sharing 

- Test custom actions scripts in Windows, see if I can leverage that for customizations.
